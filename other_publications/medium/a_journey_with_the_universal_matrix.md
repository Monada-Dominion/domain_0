It originated in geometry and evolved into logical and algorithmic forms.

Recently several attempts to formalize it as a minimal necessary system for evolution were performed.

It began with making a chain of 12 evolving stages based on initial rules of the universal matrix:

Stages:
Point
Line
Intersection
Simple Shape
Double Shape
Network
Interconnection of Structures
Volume
Complete System
Interaction of Systems
Optimization
Evolution

And sketching the proof:
Skipping the “Point” (Stage 1) → No Existence.
Skipping the “Line” (Stage 2) → No Structure.
Skipping the “Intersection” (Stage 3) → No Network Development.
Skipping “Closure” (Stage 4) → No Stability.
Skipping “Duplication” (Stage 5) → No Growth.
Skipping “Network Development” (Stage 6) → No Information Flow.
Skipping “Higher-Order Connections” (Stage 7) → System Isolation.
Skipping “3D Expansion” (Stage 8) → Network Saturation.
Skipping “Full System Realization” (Stage 9) → No Complexity.
Skipping “Metasystem Transition” (Stage 10) → No Macro-Evolution.
Skipping “Optimization” (Stage 11) → System Overload.
Skipping “Evolutionary Transition” (Stage 12) → Stagnation & Collapse.

Followed by extracting geometric meaning:

Beginning, zero complexity
Connection, axis, first structure
First branching, beginning of a network
Closed contour, completeness
Complexity increase, interaction of forms
Full development of nodes
Transition to the next level
Three-dimensional complexity
Finished structure
Meta-system, external exchange
Self-correction
Transition to the next level

And acquiring Logical justification:
Without a point, there is no system; a point is the foundation of any geometry.
Without a connection between points, it is impossible to build a complex system.
Without an intersection, there is no variability or development.
Shape → law; without shape, there is no structure.
If a system cannot double itself, it cannot grow.
Without a network, a shape is dead — it does not interact.
If a shape does not become more complex, it deteriorates.
In reality, everything is three-dimensional; without this, there is no complexity.
At this stage, the matrix encompasses all connections.
If a system does not interact, it becomes isolated and deteriorates.
Any intelligent system must adapt.
Without evolution, development is impossible.

More and more attempts are required or more knowledge to validate the theory and prove the concept of universality. However, a clear property of evolution is easily recognizable.

The system grows in complexity, follows rules and repeats as a fractal.

Using it as a meta heuristic for system organization allows to quickly create a system with evolutionary nature and repeat it.

It was practically validated with LLMs. And several papers resulted as attempts to acquire the formal proof.

In other words, if initial logic is given to an LLM model with a task to build something with these rules, it will produce similar outcomes. Just like a benchmark testing it is possible to figure out how good models can comprehend the logic and follow the rules.
It appeared to be easier for models to comprehend the idea and to use it than to people.
It is also possible to use a proof by contradiction or rigorous intuitionistic derivation. These proofs are inspired by initial chain of meanings extracted from a geometric sequence. And it was referenced to the Deduction of Known Truths by Pappus of Alexandria in initial paper.

Currently it seems as an infinite journey.

I’ve been trying it myself, discussing it with others — the research never stops.
If you are capable in understanding topics relevant to the publications — your input can become an invaluable addition into universal matrix definition and application.

A dozen of possible ways to apply it were identified:
logical chains & deduction,
systems design,
scenario plotting, meta heuristic
process mapping, process representation,
mediation exercises, concentration and relaxation, in depth work with attention,
card decks design and card games, UI, making graphical user interfaces,
algorithmic representation, building algorithms, making programs,
dancing and posing, gesture and pose systems,
making LLM system prompts, making LLM agents,
planning and time management,
creating art pieces in literature, drawing,
teaching or creating educational materials.

Finally, heuristic problem solving and process mining became two main focus points. And this is what team behind VINO AI is working on.

We would welcome input in terms of practical application and knowledge sharing in any domain and are open to share our experience.
